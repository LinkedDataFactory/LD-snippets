## These subsequent SPARQL scripts change old URIs into new URIs with UUIDs as QN

##**Step 1**: 
## Replace old subject QN with UUID. Be aware of the last character of the BaseURI..has or ##slash..this example is based on hash (#). Save changed subjects graph.
## Run the following query and save the output to a new file, this is the subjects file, because here the subjects have a new URI

prefix temp: <http://temp.org/> 

CONSTRUCT { ?newuri ?p ?o ;
				temp:olduri ?inst .
			}
WHERE {
  ?class a owl:Class .
     ?inst a ?class .
BIND (SUBSTR(str(UUID()), 10) as ?uid)
?inst ?p ?o .
BIND (strafter(str(?inst),"#") as ?qn)
BIND (URI(replace(str(?inst),?qn, ?uid  )) as ?newuri)
}

## Step 2: In the new subjects graph create a pointer for mapping old-new URI by running the query below. 
## Save this mapping graph as a separate graph and set the BaseURI to http://map.org/

prefix koppel: <http://koppel.nl/>
prefix temp: <http://temp.org/>

CONSTRUCT {?s koppel:mij ?olduri }
WHERE {
?s temp:olduri ?olduri
}

## Step 3: replace old object URI by new UUID-URI by 
## 1) importing (owl:import) the mapping graph from step 2 in the subjects graph and running the query below. 
## 2) Save results as a new graph with the name "objects graph" (separate save is for safety. If you are happy with the results you can directly do an insert). 
## 3) After this, import the generated triples of the objects graph into the subjects graph

prefix koppel: <http://koppel.nl/>
prefix temp: <http://temp.org/>

CONSTRUCT {?s ?p ?s2}
#SELECT distinct ?p
WHERE {
    ?s ?p ?o .
FILTER (?p NOT IN (temp:olduri , koppel:mij ))
{
SELECT * 
WHERE  {GRAPH <http://koppel.nl/> {
?s2 ?p2 ?o
}

}}}


## Step 4: There are now redundant temporary triples in the subject graph that must be removed. See query below.
## End result: Your subjects graph is now your new graph with UUIDs as QN in URIs 


prefix koppel: <http://koppel.nl/>
prefix temp: <http://temp.org/>

DELETE {?s ?p ?o}

WHERE {
    ?s ?p ?o .
{
SELECT * 
WHERE  {GRAPH <http://koppel.nl/> {
?s2 ?p2 ?o
}

}}}
